# Banking_Marketing_Subscription
Purpose of these campaigns is to prompt the clients to subscribe for a specific financial product of the bank (term deposit). After each call was conducted, the client had to inform the institution about their intention of either subscribing to the product (indicating a successful campaign) or not (unsucessful campaign).
